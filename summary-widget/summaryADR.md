# Summary Widget SWOT Analysis

### Strength

1. Started planning and developing early on so product is made well and fine tuned
2. Is in theme with universal design for DevDiary

### Weakness

1. Although implementation is good it lacks quality of life change that are needed such as an unfurl dropdown animation and hover attributes
2. Although the overall theme fits the total project many labels need to be changed to favicons becuase that it what is used in the skeleton code.

### Opportunity

1. Many animation function examples are popular online, can look into that and learn to implement it into the program
2. Can get access to all the resources needed to implement exactly into the skeleton code.

### Threat

1. Timing and being busy with other commitements
2. The widget itself not being programmed well enough to cleanly integrate the proposed changes
3. Final Project is due in 2 weeks.

### Conclusion

The summary widget was well programed becuase its developenent started early, it also fits into the unviersal theme of the project.
However, it lacks important aspects like complete integration and many animation functions that need to be included. Overall, if worked on
efficiently, it will reach the goals I have for it.
