# Sleep Widget Solution

## Context and Problem Statement
For developers, tracking sleep time is helpful to understanding and improving their concentration and productivity. Through the Sleep Widget, we will develop a feature that allows them to easily track their sleep time.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* Intuitive UI Design.
* Appropriate form to be displayed in the pop-up screen that appears when the sleep button is pressed.

## Considered Options

* Horizontal slidebar and five options of sleep hours.
* Vertival slidebar and five options of sleep hours.

## Decision Outcome

We choose option 2, as our pop-up screen was a vertical rectangle so that vertical slidebar was more suitable. Additonally, we added a emoji to the right-slide of each sleep-hour option, which makes the UI more intuitive.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
### Consequences

* Good, it is consistent as one function within the entire application.
* Bad, because implementing a vertical slidebar was not trivial problem in html and css, so that the source code became a little complicated.
